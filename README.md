## Summary
Whilst object detection is a mature and heavily researched topic within the computer vision and deep learning spaces, identifying the names of objects alone is insubstantial in many applications. In a world where everyday consumers are interacting with sophistcated technologies, it is imperative AI can do more to interact with humans tha just single words, instead having the ability to form accurate and grammatically sound descriptions of scenes in image. The applications are endles, including child education and health assistants for elderly or visually disabled.  

With this piece of work, an attempt is made to solve a frequent (yet somehwat less empathizing to society compared to the applications mentioned above) problem - deciding on a caption for the latest instagram post. 


Note on dependencies:

for cuda 10.1, tensorflow 2.3.1 didn't pick up GPU. Instead 2.2 worked.
